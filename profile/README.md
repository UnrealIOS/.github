our approach to computing: User on User's device needs only one software/content set - vendored by developers of this repository. It should be tailored to User's needs; User should be able to participate in it's development and optionally pay for it to increase autogeneration speed/developer human helpers impressions of that Case.

User should be able to see a marketing site of each application with up-to-date simulator UI Testing videos and autogenerated change log

User should be able to download application and write Twitter review in on-website Twitter hashtag chat

User should be able to receive a response from chatbot if chatbot finds question worth answering

User should be able to browse few sections of marketing materials - generate them at first impression with loading screen and explanation/turnable on off by click animation visualisation of what is happening/full line by line logs in background
