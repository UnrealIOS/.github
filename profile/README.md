# Generate Marketplace

we are selling users a website with depiction of the product of their dream with A/B testing and eventual delivery

kickstarter for software and gadgets with Eth trust human oracle court based delivery guarantees

linkedin meets VSCode for instant Eth earning by working on preffered open source software

text editor to screen Movie generator

Book/Movie/Software/Music/Games/Assets/Physical Goods publishing/Distribution system



our approach to computing: User on User's device needs only one software/content set - vendored by developers of this repository. It should be tailored to User's needs; User should be able to participate in it's development and optionally pay for it to increase autogeneration speed/developer human helpers impressions of that Case.

User should be able to see a marketing site of each application with up-to-date simulator UI Testing videos and autogenerated change log

User should be able to download application and write Twitter review in on-website Twitter hashtag chat

User should be able to receive a response from chatbot if chatbot finds question worth answering

User should be able to browse few sections of marketing materials - generate them at first impression with loading screen and explanation/turnable on off by click animation visualisation of what is happening/full line by line logs in background
